        <h4>FAQs</h4>
        <s-itemgrow>
          <h5>When are formal dinners? What do I have to wear? Can I bring guests?</h5>
          <p>Formal dinners are three-course dinners held in Hall and are open to all students, with a sign-up held on the preceding Monday at 9am. Last year they were held on Sunday evenings and Wednesday evenings, although the Wednesday evening formal is being moved to Thursdays and Fridays alternately in order to accommodate as many people as possible this year. Dress code for formals is smart with gowns. There are also Guest Night formals on the Friday nights of 4th and 8th weeks, which are an even swankier version of the normal formals. You can bring up to 3 guests to formal dinners, which you book on using the sign-up system explained below.</p>
          <h5>How do I book formal dinners? What do I do if I want to swap or cancel it?</h5>
          <p><a href="http://meals.hertford.ox.ac.uk/asmeals">This link</a> takes you to a different site where you can sign in with your SSO and go through the signup process there. If you want to swap it, then cancel your spot and make sure your friend is on the site at the same time to pick it up. If you want to cancel it, make sure you do so before 10am on the morning of the formal, or at 10am on the preceding Friday for Sunday night formals.</p>
          <h5>What if the signup isn't working?</h5>
          <p>Let the Food and Housing Officer know. If it's not working for you, then odds are that it isn't working for everyone else. The Food and Housing Officer will endeavor to get it sorted quickly and fairly and will update the JCR Facebook page accordingly.</p>
          <h5>I had a terrible meal in Hall. What can I do about it?</h5>
          <p>On the JCR pinned post there is a page entitled Hertfood Review. Use it to review your meal - either good or bad - and the chefs will be able to see it and respond to your needs.</p>
          <h5>I have a special dietary requirement - how can I ensure that I am catered for in Hall?</h5>
          <p>On the form for formal dinners, there is a section where you can stipulate the requirements for you and your guests if needed. For main meals, all allergens are listed on the noticeboard outside hall, and vegetarian and gluten free items are listed on the menu posted on the JCR Facebook page. For other dietary requirements, get in touch with the kitchen in advance (at the start of the week, preferably) and let them know when and what you will require.</p>

      <h3>General meetings</h3>
      <s-item>
        <h4>FAQs</h4>
        <s-itemgrow>
          <h5>What’s in the Bulletin? Why should I read it?</h5>
          <p>The Bulleting is mostly an update on the activity of the Exec and a reminder of any elections or meetings coming up. If you plan to run for a position, or if you want to see what the committee has been doing, you should give it a read. I also take pride in filling each bulletin with offensively bad jokes and endearing charm, so maybe that will get you jazzed also. Sometimes the bulletin also has useful info on internships and other interesting opportunities around Oxford.</p>
          <h5>When do I need to submit my motion/manifesto by?</h5>
          <p>General meeting are Sunday at 7PM on 2<sup>nd</sup>/5<sup>th</sup>/8<sup>th</sup> weeks. Your manifestos need to be sent to me by 8PM on the Wednesday of that week, and motions by 8PM on the Thursday.</p>
          <h5>What are the Constitution/Standing Orders?</h5>
          <p>They are the central guidelines for how democratic processes are carried out in the JCR. The constitution lays out the duties of the Exec, and the standing orders act as a supplement. They tell us things like the roles of each member of the Exec, the number of JCR members required to make a meeting quorate, and the way husts are to be carried out. They are supposed to cover every situation that the president and their exec may have to deal with during their term. The President has sole interpretive rights to the constitution, but may be challenged by any JCR member, or overruled by a 2/3 majority in a JCR meeting. The constitution can even be changed with a 2/3 majority in two successive meetings.</p>
          <h5>What is a Hust?</h5>
          <p>It’s a short (2 minute) speech made to the JCR to convince them of your suitability for the role. This is usually done at JCR general meetings.</p>

      <s-item>
        <h4>FAQs</h4>
        <s-itemgrow>
          <h5>How do I pay my Battels?</h5>
          <p>Head to the Bursary (in OB2) and pay via card or cheque or do an online bank transfer to college (see the bottom of your Battels for bank details) quoting your account number in the reference.</p>
          <h5>Something isn’t right on my Battels...</h5>
          <p>Drop me a message or an email and I might be able to explain. If this doesn’t clear things up email <a href="mailto:raquel.goold@hertford.ox.ac.uk">Raquel Goold</a> and CC me in (zoe.hallett@hertford.ox.ac.uk) explaining the issue.</p>
          <h5>How do I go about getting funding for X?</h5>
          <p>Submitting a motion to a JCR meeting is the most commonly used way of getting funding. If you need any advice on what to include in the motion or want information about how much of the JCR motions budget has been spent etc. then please ask me and I’ll be happy to help.</p>
          <h5>Can I have a look at the JCR Budgets?</h5>
          <p>Yes! Any JCR member can look at the budgets, if you want to see them or a copy of the presentation of the Budgets for this year feel free to ask and I will send you them.</p>

          <h5>What does ACAF actually do?</h5>
          <p>In a nutshell the ACAF officer provides information and advice about the academic affairs in college. This can be anything from problems with tutors to helping students book rooms. If you want a better understanding of the role then take a look at the description of the role in the college constitution. AMEND?</p>
          <h5>I’m having problems with a tutor, what do I do?</h5>
          <p>Problems with tutors can include a tutor not giving work back on time, setting too much work that is unrealistic, making comments that make you feel uncomfortable and upset and much more.

        <h4>FAQs</h4>
        <s-itemgrow>
          
          <h5>What supplies can I get from the Welfare Officers?</h5>
          <p>We can pidge:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>- Condoms (also available for free from condom machines: HW5 ground floor toilet, and laundry rooms in Warnock and Leckford)</li>
            <li>- Pregnancy Tests</li>
            <li>- Lube</li>
            <li>- Attack Alarms</li>
            <li>- Dental dams</li>
            <li>- Earplugs</li>
          </ul>
          <p></p>
          <h5>How can I get these supplies?</h5>
          <p>Contact a welfare officer – just email or message us, or fill out the form. We will pidge the requested supplies to you!</p>
          <p>We will generally pidge within 24 hours. If the supply is urgent (e.g. pregnancy tests), we will pidge ASAP.</p>
          
          <h5>If I buy supplies elsewhere, can the JCR reimburse me?</h5>
          <p>If you choose to buy any of the supplies listed above, the JCR will not subsidise you. However, there are a few items which cannot be pidged but can be subsidised:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>- Mooncups: the JCR will subsidise half the price of a Mooncup. Students who purchase one can email one of us and pidge us the receipt. We will then pidge back half the cost, to the nearest pound.</li>
            <li>- Morning After Pill: When students purchase the morning after pill from a pharmacy, the JCR will subsidise 50% of the cost. Students must email one of us, and then pidge them the receipt. We will pidge them the money. Note: It is often possible to get the morning after pill for free on weekdays at a pharmacy (e.g. Boots) if you have a consultation and fill in a form.</li>
          </ul>
          <p></p>
          
          <h5>Welfare teas: What are they and why should I go?</h5>
          <p>The purpose of welfare teas is to provide a friendly and relaxing environment in college. They are events which happen three times each term (often weeks 3, 5, and 7), usually in the JCR common room. All members of the JCR are invited (massively encouraged!!) to attend. Welfare teas are an opportunity to meet new people, chat to welfare officers and peer supporters, eat free food, and have important breaks from academic work.</p>
          <h5>Welfare Taxis: What are they and when can I use one?</h5>
          <p>When there is a valid welfare concern, JCR students are able to use a taxi which is fully subsidised (batteled £0) by college. Of course, all cases and circumstances vary, but examples of valid reasons for taking a JCR taxi include:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>- Emergencies that require immediate medical attention</li>
            <li>- Alone at night and feel unsafe walking home</li>
            <li>- Immobility – if a person is unable to take other means of transport they may use a welfare taxi (note: if this is the case for a long period of time, it must be negotiated with the Welfare Officers)</li>
            <li>- Any circumstance in which the use of the JCR taxi will remove a student from a potentially harmful situation, particularly if they are alone</li>
          </ul>
          <p></p>
          <p>Previously arranged trips to the JR Hospital are unlikely to be valid for subsidisation, unless mobility is an issue. The use of welfare taxis to the SARC (Sexual Assault Referral Centre) in Slough IS VALID.</p>
          <h5>How do I book a welfare taxi?</h5>
          <ul>
            <li>- Ring the lodge and ask to book a welfare taxi</li>
            <li>- Provide Bodcard number, pick-up location and destination</li>
            <li>- Email Welfare Officers within 48 HOURS with reason, for assessment of validity. (Note: this step is vital. Even if the lodge is aware of the reason, please email the Welfare Officers.)</li>
          </ul>
          <p></p>
          <p>If the given reason is valid, the student will be batteled £0. Otherwise, the student will be batteled the cost of the taxi.</p>
          
          <h5>Where are sexual health clinics in Oxford?</h5>
          <p>There are 3 clinics in Oxford which together provide a comprehensive range of contraception and sexual health services:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>- Rectory Centre: Rectory Road, East Oxford, OX4 1BU</li>
            <li>The Churchill Hospital, Old Road, Headington, OX3 7LE</li>
            <li>Orchard Health Centre, Cope Road, Banbury, OX16 2EZ</li>
          </ul>
          <p></p>
          <p>There are also clinics in Abingdon, Bicester, Didcot, Kidlington, Wantage and Witney; full details <a href="https://www.sexualhealthoxfordshire.nhs.uk">here</a>.</p>

      <h3>Student support fund</h3>
      <s-item>
        <h4>FAQs</h4>
        <s-itemgrow>
          <h5>What is it?</h5>
          <p>The Student Support Fund is designed to help out Hertford students who come into unexpected financial difficulty due to circumstances beyond their direct control. Alumni donate funds specifically for this purpose. All Hertford students are eligible whether graduate or undergraduate, UK or overseas.</p>
          <h5>What is it typically awarded for?</h5>
          <ul>
            <li>– Students who are not in receipt of government grants, the full Oxford Opportunity Bursary or Hertford College bursary, whose parents are not in a position to fund term time living costs to the extent required and who have no other funds to draw on.</li>
            <li>– Students whose financial circumstances have changed during the year and have not yet been reassessed by the SLC for a higher level of grant which would in turn trigger OOB and Hertford Bursary Funds.</li>
            <li>– Students who experience unexpected changes to their financial circumstances for reasons outside their control during their degree course.</li>
          </ul>
          <h5>How much are the grants?</h5>
          <p>Grants are typically between £200 and £800 per term depending on the circumstances and the level of funds available. In circumstances where financial hardship is temporary, the college may make an interest free loan. Grants may be one-off termly grants to help a student through a difficult period or may be repeated if the financial circumstances persist. However, students will need to apply for each term that support is requested.</p>
          <h5>How do I apply?</h5>
          <p>Complete an application form – available below – or email <span class="memail">raquel.goold@hertford.ox.ac.uk</span> in the bursary. All financial details will be kept strictly confidential to the Student Support Committee (the Dean (Chair), Bursary and the Tutor for Graduates) and the bursary.</p>
          <h5>When do I apply?</h5>
          <p>Applications must be submitted to the Bursary by the end of 2<sup>nd</sup> or 6<sup>th</sup> week each term. Discussions will take place in 3<sup>rd</sup> and 7<sup>th</sup> week, after which the college will contact students to let them know whether their application has been successful or not and why.</p>
          <h5>Other questions</h5>
          <p>If there are any problems or further questions, please don't hesitate to get in contact with either the bursary or the welfare officers.</p>

          <h5>Expected Behaviour</h5>
          <ul>
            <li>Your role is primarily preventative and intended to provide support in addition to that which friends can be expected to provide.</li>
            <li>You are not expected to do anything which makes you uncomfortable. If you cannot do something yourself then let someone else know – we will not ask questions.</li>
            <li>You must be capable of making reponsible decisions in the best interests of others. This means staying sober. You can drink before and during your shift but be aware of your limits.</li>
            <li>You must be visible. We provide high visibility jackets which you will be given by the Angel before you but you also need to make sure to move around and keep a look out for people in bathrooms and outside as well as by your friends.</li>
            <li>If you feel someone is in danger of harming themselves or others either intervene yoursself, or speak to Entz, Welfare, or the bouncers. Do not attempt first aid if not trained and do not intervene if in danger.</li>
            <li>Ensure an appropriate handover to the person following your shift. If there's anyone you have been monitoring let them know so that they can look out for them later.</li>
          </ul>
          <h5>Important Information</h5>
          <ul>
            <li>You may be asked to call a welfare taxi or walk somebody home. If you do, send Welfare an email explaining who the taxi was for and where it went.</li>
            <li>If someone is going to vomit a welfare taxi will not take them and likewise they shouldn't be left unmonitored. Stay with them, and give them water and fresh air if possible until they sober up enough.</li>
            <li>If you do leave the bop please let Entz and your fellow welfairies know.</li>
            <li>If someone discloses an instance of sexual violence to you and you want help or advice, the Welfare and Entz team have been trained and you should get in touch with them.</li>
          </ul>

          <h5>Something has broken in my room, what do I do?</h5>
          <p>If something has broken or isn't right in your room, i.e. a light bulb has blown, your taps are broken, you have mould or pests or whatever, then send an email to Hertford's domestic manager, Karen Smith, and CC in the Food and Housing Officer and Caroline Balfour, the head housekeeper. It's also probably a good idea to CC in your housekeeper if you're off main site, but for fresher's this shouldn't be an issue until you're in second year. Karen will pass your problems onto maintenance, who will sort them out as quickly as they can. Karen's not around 24/7 however (she's in college during office hours) so if it's an urgent problem and it hasn't happened between 9 and 5 Monday to Friday, your best bet is the lodge. They're trained to sort most things out, but if not they will be able to get maintenance in to sort it out.</p>
          <h5>My laundry is stuck in the machine/the machine isn't working/something has gone wrong. What do I do?</h5>
          <p>Firstly, there is a lot of history to this - this used to happen A LOT. Thankfully, completely new machines have been installed and the laundry rooms have been redecorated all over college's accommodation blocks, so this shouldn't be as big an issue for you as it has been for previous years. If, however, you encounter a problem with the machine, the first thing you need to do is ring the Circuit laundry helpline on either of the following numbers: 08000924068 or 01422820026. It's open 24/7 (during office hours by Circuit itself, outside of them by a contractor) and they will be able to sort out your problem over the phone, get a mechanic sent out if required, and (if between 9-5 M-F) process a refund if required.</p>
          <h5>What am I allowed to keep in my room? What isn't allowed?</h5>
          <p>There is a long list of items that are and aren't allowed in college accommodation, far too many for this small answer - you can find a more extensive list on the website, although even this isn't exhaustive. In short, anything with fire is strictly prohibited i.e. candles, incense sticks, grills, toastie makers etc. But you can have kettles (which is a perk) and a small fridge (as long as it is kept clean), as long as they are PAT tested. Pod coffee machines are allowed, but bean-to-cup and pump machines are not. Check the website if you aren't sure about something, and if it isn't listed there, then get in touch with the Food and Housing Officer.</p>

        <h4>Overview</h4>
        <s-itemgrow>
          <p>If you are wanting to use a gym Hertford does have its own gym, however it is by no means expansive and the more serious gym-goer may want to get membership elsewhere. The university <a href="http://www.sport.ox.ac.uk/membership/membership/student-membership">also has a gym on the Iffley Road</a>.</p>
          <p>The University runs <a href="http:// www.sport.ox.ac.uk/offer/peak-sporting-performance">offers relating to sports physiotherapy and other related services</a>.</p>
          <p>Oxford has an extensive number of sports clubs competing at a range of difficulties and levels; more details <a href="http://www.sport.ox.ac.uk/student-sport/ sports-clubs">here</a>.</p>

        <h4>FAQs</h4>
        <s-itemgrow>
          <h5>What is the Blues Fund/can I get funding to help pay for costs of uni sport?</h5>
          <p>The Blues Fund is a fund designed so that all who want to can access University level sports without being put off by financial costs. The level of funding available depends on numbers applying and the applicant’s involvement in University sport. There is a guarantee that you will get the money back for subscription fees for the year for playing for your chosen team so long as they don’t exceed the limit of £100. On top of this the amount of money available is dependent on applicant numbers. Please make any applications or enquiries well before the deadline of Sunday 5th Week Trinity. Failure to do so means there is no guarantee of financial support.</p>
          <h5>Can I hire out the sports grounds?</h5>
          <p>Yes, email <a href="mailto:alan.sula@sport.ac.ox.uk">Alan Sula</a> to book, and then pick up the key from the old lodge. Please return them after usage as there is a limited supply of keys and there have been instances where teams have been locked out of facilities.</p>
          <h5>Does any college sport cost money to play?</h5>
          <p>No, everything is completely free to participate in, as we have a sports budget which covers the running costs of all teams. The exception to this is rowing which costs £35 a term (battled).</p>
          <h5>I’ve injured myself playing X - what are the nurses hours? What can college do to help?</h5>
          <p>Please contact the college Nurse as a first point of contact; her details, can be found <a href="https:// www.hertford.ox.ac.uk/my-hertford/health-welfare/hertford-welfare-support/college-nurse">here</a> and her hours under 'Welfare'. Additionally, please speak to the Sports Officer to see if they can help in any way as they can help to ensure additional required services are available. As this may be an issue that is a joint welfare and sport issue the usage of welfare taxis and other welfare services may be applicable; just ask if in doubt!</p>
          <h5>Where can I get the key for the Sports Cupboard?</h5>
          <p>The key for the Sports Cupboard is stored in the lodge – please go there and ask for it.</p>
