    <h1>Welcome to Hertford</h1>
    <p>This is a brief overview of what you would actually want to know about Hertford, instead of waffle about entry requirements and generally boring advertising.</p>
    <p>Here, we will try to give you an unbiased account of Hertford life without any nonsense.</p>
    <p>More detailed information is available on our Access website, along with videos, blog posts, virtual tours, and stories about our college from current students.</p>
    <p>We hope this will dispel any worries you have about the college, and we welcome any feedback you have.</p>

        <h3>Sports</h3>
        <p>Sport is a big part of life at Hertford, and while the focus is on inclusivity and making sport accessible to all, Hertford also enjoys a considerable amount of sporting success. Last year, the cricket team won the university-wide ‘Cuppers’ tournament, with the rugby team and women’s football team also coming close to victory. All sports welcome complete beginners, so whatever your prior experience, and however much time you want to dedicate to sport, there will definitely be either one or many sports that you can pick up at Hertford!</p>
        <p>Commitment varies massively between sports – the lacrosse and frisbee teams have matches every two or three weeks, whilst the college’s best rowers train up to six times per week. Most teams also have really fun socials and an annual dinner to celebrate their achievements, as well as ‘stash’: customised sports clothing organised by each team.</p>
        <p>Sport at Hertford is very well funded, and with the exception of rowing (which costs £40 per term), nobody pays to participate or compete in college level sport. Many Hertford JCR members benefit from the college’s ‘Blues Fund’, which consists of £5,000 given by Hertford College and divided between university sport players to pay for their annual subs and other expenses associated with playing sport at university level. This ensures that there are no financial barriers preventing anyone at Hertford from participating in sport at any level.</p>
        <p>Our college sports grounds in Marston (around 15 minutes’ walk from Hertford) has three full sized pitches, squash and tennis courts, and a pavilion which is used as a changing room. We also have a reasonably well equipped gym in college, which is located in the basement of the NB3 staircase. All of these facilities are freely available to be used by college members at any time.</p>

        <h3>IT</h3>
        <p>Every room owned by the college has complete access to both a wireless and wired connection to the Internet, with both offering good speeds. There are college computer rooms and multiple printers available, as well as an online web-print system. Whenever something breaks, the IT office and officers will be there to help.</p>
        <p>The IT Office is able to loan out notebooks to everyone that needs one, and there are four projectors (and cables) available to borrow for film nights.</p>
